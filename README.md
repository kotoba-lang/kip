# kip

**KIP — Kotoba Improvement Proposal.** The numbered, cross-repository queue for
changes to the normative surfaces of the kotoba-lang workspace: EIP and IPIP's
job, done with the parts this workspace already has.

The name is an acronym, not a word, so this paragraph is the naming: `kip` holds
the *registry* (`kips/kip-NNNN.edn`), the *process authority*
(`lang/kip-process.edn`, machine-normative), and the *validator* that reads
them. It does not hold decisions — those stay in ADRs — and it does not hold
agent-effect approvals, which are
[`kotoba-issue`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-issue)'s job.

## What was missing, precisely

Measured 2026-08-16 across all 4,187 west projects: no repository and no
document describes a proposal process. What already exists, and is in several
places better than the thing being copied:

| EIP/IPIP's job | already here | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| the proposal document | ADRs — 43 in `kotoba-lang`, 221 in the compiler, thousands in the superproject | `surface-status.edn` already says widening a security constraint *"requires an ADR"* |
| editors | `docs/authority-map.edn` names an owner per normative surface | **better than EIP** — it is machine-checked |
| what Final costs | `lang/version-policy.edn`: 180-day deprecation floor, removal-requires-major, signed release tags binding the profile | **EIP has no equivalent** |
| propose → review → merge machinery | `kotoba-issue` + `kotoba-ledger`, with an append-only ledger | exists; its subject is agent effects |
| threshold voting | `kagami govern`, N-of-M from an allow-list | exists; its subject is west pins |

So the organs were all there. The gap is narrow and specific: **there is no
state between "someone is thinking about it" and "it is decided and written
up."** An ADR is written by the party that already decided. A KIP is the thing a
second person can object to *before* the fact — and because no queue existed,
nothing could check that a change to a normative surface went through one.

## The process

```
 draft ──author──▶ review ──editor──▶ last-call ──quorum──▶ final
   │                 ▲  │               │  │                  │
   │          editor ┘  │        editor ┘  │           quorum │
   │        (changes    │       (objection)│                  ▼
   │        requested)  │                  │              superseded
   └──────author────────┴──────────────────┴──▶ withdrawn
                        └──────editor──────┴──▶ rejected
```

- **standards** track changes a normative surface: last call *and* quorum.
- **process** and **informational** tracks: editors close them out of review.
  There is no last call because on those tracks the editors are the affected
  party.
- **Last call is 14 days minimum**, measured from `:kip/last-call-started`. The
  clock is the load-bearing part — a window with no minimum closes whenever the
  author is ready, which is the same as not having one. 14 days is the shortest
  interval that survives one person being away, which is the only failure mode a
  last call prevents.
- **`:editor` is not a standing committee.** For a given KIP it is the set of
  authority owners named by `lang/normative-surfaces.edn` for the surfaces that
  KIP touches. Who may advance it is a function of what it changes.
- **`:quorum` is 2 distinct signers** from `manifest/fleet-keys.edn`
  `:canonical :allow` in the superproject — the same list `kagami govern` reads.
  That list is *referenced, never copied*: two copies of a key list is two
  answers to who may sign.

`lang/kip-process.edn` is what the validator reads and is authoritative;
`kips/kip-0000.edn` is the human-readable statement of the same thing. If they
disagree the EDN wins — the same split `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang` keeps between
`docs/lang/semantics-ssot.md` and `lang/guest-grammar.edn`.

## Layout

```
lang/kip-process.edn        machine-normative: states, transitions, guards, diagnostics
lang/normative-surfaces.edn which paths are under the process (:adopted / :proposed)
kips/kip-NNNN.edn           the registry — DataScript tx-data, :source/dataset "kip"
kotoba/kip_gate_core.kotoba the decision core: word-typed, native-admissible
src/kotoba/kip/core.cljc    codes, requirements, dates, reading documents
src/kotoba/kip/registry.cljc numbering, duplicates, dangling references
src/kotoba/kip/quorum.cljc  what makes a KIP Final: signatures over one payload
scripts/check-kips.cljs     the gate (nbb)
```

## Running it

```sh
npx --yes nbb --classpath src scripts/check-kips.cljs . \
  --surfaces ../kotoba-lang/docs/authority-map.edn

clojure -M:test          # 60 tests — includes the .kotoba parity sweep
clojure -M:test-pure     # the .cljc suite alone, no compiler dependency
```

`<root>` must be the **first** positional argument. Several gates in this
workspace take the tree as `(first (remove #(str/starts-with? % "--") argv))`,
so `check-kips.cljs --surfaces x .` would silently treat `x` as the tree.

### Exit codes

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | checked, no errors |
| 1 | checked, errors found |
| **2** | **could not answer** — inputs missing or unreadable |

2 exists because 0 and 1 are both claims about the registry and "I never saw the
registry" is not one of them. `SCANNED` and `READ-OK` print every run and an
empty `kips/` exits 2 rather than reporting a clean sweep of nothing. Fourteen
instances of a check returning its pass value when it could not run were found
in this workspace in a single day (ADR-2608136000); an evidence floor plus a
third exit code is what fixed them.

Measured 2026-08-16, all four paths:

```
healthy tree         exit 0   SCANNED 2   RESULT pass
empty registry       exit 2   SCANNED 0   RESULT could-not-answer
missing process file exit 2               RESULT could-not-answer
planted duplicate    exit 1   SCANNED 3   RESULT fail
                              ERROR :kip/duplicate-number ["kips/kip-0000.edn" "kips/kip-0002.edn"]
```

## The decision core is `.kotoba`

`kotoba/kip_gate_core.kotoba` holds the judgement — may this KIP move from this
state to that one, and if not, which diagnostic — in `:i64`, `:bool` and two
sealed scalar records, which is what `kotoba-kir`'s
`only-native-word-typed-features?` admits. Collections, IO and the keyword
mapping stay in `.cljc`. That is the decision-core split, the same shape
murakumo's `kotoba/*_core.kotoba` use.

`test/kotoba/kip/kip_gate_kotoba_parity_test.clj` compiles the real source and
compares it against the `.cljc` on the **full** cross product — 441 state/role/
track cases and 160 guard cases, not a sample — and then compiles a
deliberately broken copy and asserts the sweep catches it, and that the cases
which flip are the ones the mutation touched.

Two measurements worth keeping:

- **`max-parameters` is 5** (amu `1e21a1f`). A 12-parameter `transition-code` is
  rejected at `:subset` with `:kotoba.error/max-parameters`. Two sealed records
  carry twelve fields through two parameters. Packing the flags into a bitmask
  would also fit and is the wrong answer — murakumo already went the other way
  (T5.3 replaced base-N packing with records), because a packed `i64` loses the
  field names that make the guard readable.
- `record-new` is a special form and is **not** subject to that limit
  (`max-record-fields` is 32).

## Quorum

`kotoba.kip.quorum` is deliberately the same shape as
`kagami.grant/admit-quorum`, which decides canonical west pin advances: an
allow-set, a threshold, distinct valid signatures over one canonical payload,
crypto injected, verdict plus reasons out. Two quorum mechanisms with different
shapes in one workspace would be two things to get right.

Nothing in this repository does crypto or holds a key list. `verify-fn`,
`did->pubkey-hex` and `hash-fn` are arguments; the allow-list is
`manifest/fleet-keys.edn` `:canonical` in the superproject — **the same one
kagami reads** — and a copy here would be a second answer to who may sign. The
wiring lives in the superproject:

```sh
CP="orgs/kotoba-lang/kip/src:orgs/kotoba-lang/kagami/src"
nbb --classpath "$CP" scripts/kip-sign.cljs --kip kip-0001 --kagi fleet-gov1 --write
nbb --classpath "$CP" scripts/kip-sign.cljs --kip kip-0001 --kagi fleet-gov2 --write
nbb --classpath "$CP" scripts/verify-kip-quorum.cljs      # only then set :final
```

**The signature covers the whole document except `:kip/quorum`.** Signatures
accumulate inside the file, so the digest must exclude them or the first one
changes what the second is signing. Everything else is covered including the
prose: a Final KIP whose specification was edited afterwards is a different KIP,
and `editing-a-final-kip-invalidates-its-quorum` is the test that says so.
`:kip/surfaces` is normalised (sorted, de-duplicated) on both sides of the
payload, so a cosmetic reorder is free and adding or removing a surface is not.

Measured 2026-08-16 with two throwaway ed25519 keys and a scratch 2-of-2 policy
(`--policy-file` / `--kips` exist so this can be shown failing without signing a
real KIP with a real governance key):

```
empty quorum      exit 1   REJECT  0/2 valid of 0 claimed  [:quorum-not-met]
one signature     exit 1   REJECT  1/2 valid of 1 claimed  [:quorum-not-met]
two signatures    exit 0   ADMIT   2/2 valid of 2 claimed
```

That sequence found a real bug: `--write` matched the quorum blob with
`"[^\"]*"`, which stops at the first escaped quote inside it. The **first**
signature wrote fine and the **second** appended past the truncated match and
corrupted the file — a defect only the two-signature path shows, which is the
only path that matters. `--write` now re-reads what it produced and refuses to
save anything that does not parse back to the expected signature count.

The verifier also self-checks node's ed25519 before trusting any answer — a
round-trip it must accept and a corrupted signature it must reject. Without
that, a broken verifier and a registry full of bad signatures produce the same
output.

## What is deliberately not here

**A quorum of one party holding every key is not independent review.** The
policy is 2-of-3 and all three keys are reachable from one kagi vault, so what
the tooling can enforce is *two distinct keys*, not two distinct people. That is
the honest limit of a single-owner keyring, and `kip-sign.cljs` says so at the
top rather than leaving it implied.

**Nothing is `:final`.** kip-0000 and kip-0001 are both `:review`. Admitting
them is an owner action — the commands are under Quorum above — not something
the tooling does on its own.

**Coverage is not a fleet gate.** "Did this change to a normative surface
actually have a KIP" needs another repository's git history and this registry at
the same time, and a fleet gate is handed exactly one repository's tree. That
check lives operator-side at `scripts/verify-kip-coverage.cljs` in the
superproject. The precedent is `root-permit-index`, landed as a fleet gate whose
generator reads `orgs/cloud-itonami` — a path the root repository's git tree
does not contain. It has run about 300 times and has never been green. A gate
that cannot see its input is not strict, it is silent.

## Relationship to the neighbours

- **ADRs** keep doing exactly what they do. A KIP precedes a decision; an ADR
  records one. A Final KIP will usually be followed by an ADR in the repository
  that implements it.
- **`kotoba-issue` / `kotoba-ledger`** share the `issue → proposal → review →
  merge → audit` vocabulary by convention, not by dependency (the same
  arrangement those two have with each other). Their subject is agent effects.
- **`kagami govern`** owns the key list and the signature scheme. This
  repository references its allow-list and will call its verifier; it does not
  restate either.
