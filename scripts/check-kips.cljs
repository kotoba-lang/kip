;; check-kips.cljs — registry integrity for kotoba-lang/kip.
;;
;;   npx --yes nbb --classpath <root>/src <root>/scripts/check-kips.cljs <root> [--surfaces <authority-map.edn>]
;;
;; <root> must be the FIRST positional argument. Several gates in this workspace
;; take the tree as `(first (remove #(str/starts-with? % "--") argv))`, so
;; `check-kips.cljs --surfaces x .` would silently treat "x" as the tree. The
;; fleet runner passes <dir> first; a human running it by hand is the one who
;; gets this wrong (measured 2026-08-10, three gates misdiagnosed that way).
;;
;; ## Exit codes
;;
;;   0  checked, no errors
;;   1  checked, errors found
;;   2  COULD NOT ANSWER — inputs missing or unreadable
;;
;; 2 exists because 0 and 1 are both claims about the registry, and "I never saw
;; the registry" is not one of them. Fourteen instances of a check that returns
;; its pass value when it could not run were found in this workspace in a single
;; day (ADR-2608136000); the distinguishing fix that worked was an evidence
;; floor plus a third exit code, and both are here.
;;
;; ## Lines that are not findings
;;
;; SCANNED / READ-OK are the evidence floor. QUORUM-VERIFY and SURFACE-DRIFT
;; always print, and always say `ok`, `skipped:<why>` or `FAIL`, so that a check
;; that did not run cannot be read as one that passed.
