  "Integrity of the KIP registry as a whole: numbering, statuses, and the
  references KIPs make to each other.

  Per-document rules live in `kotoba.kip.core`. What is here is everything that
  needs to see more than one document at a time, which is why it cannot be a
  document-level check: a duplicate number is not visible from inside either of
  the two files that share it.

  No IO. `check` takes `[{:path ... :tx-data ...}]` — the caller reads the
  files, which is what lets the same function run under nbb in the gate, under
  the JVM in the test suite, and against a hand-built fixture."
