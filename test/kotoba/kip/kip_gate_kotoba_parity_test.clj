  "Compares kotoba/kip_gate_core.kotoba against kotoba.kip.core, branch by branch.

  Two implementations of one judgement is a liability unless something compares
  them, and the workspace rule is explicit about not keeping a mirror where only
  one side gets fixed. This is the something.

  The sweep is the full cross product of states, roles and tracks (441 cases)
  plus the full guard space (160), not a sample: a sampled parity test agrees
  with a table it never visited.

  ## Why the cases are compiled rather than called with arguments

  `transition-code` takes two sealed records, and `ir/execute` passes plain
  scalars. So each case is a zero-argument `.kotoba` wrapper that builds its own
  records — the same shape murakumo's oracle parity tests use. That also means
  the record constructors themselves are under test, which calling the function
  with pre-built values would skip."
